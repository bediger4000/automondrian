# Mondrian Image Generator

I saw a web page 
[Mondrianizer in the functional language F#](http://www.clear-lines.com/blog/post/Transform-a-picture-in-the-style-of-Mondrian-with-FSharp.aspx).
This offended me on aesthetic grounds, in that a functional program should not generate "random"
images. Additionally, only Windows users can make any further use of that Mondrianizer.
That offended me on ideological grounds.

Acting on my aesthetic sensibilities, I churned out a Mondrian-like picture generator
using a dodgy, open source, imperative language, PHP.
The very sketchiness that PHP is famous for can be used to great effect
in generating "surprising" images. Now you too, can have Art,
and generate Art, if you have a PHP-enabled website.

This is another entry in the
[long line of programs](http://noll.uscannenberg.org/Art%20Papers/Mondrian.pdf)
to generate Mondrian-like artwork.

# Installation

Put the files `automondrian.php` and `mond.php` in your PHP-enabled website, probably
in the same directory. Call `automondrian.php` in your browser. Boom! Mondrian-like
images at your disposal.
